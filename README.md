San Andreas Online is an online multiplayer modification for Rockstar North's Game; Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.

As this game doesn't have a _built-in_ network play functionality, many attempts have been made since its PC release and only some of them succeeded. San Andreas Online has a goal of being unique by implementation of artifical intelligence synchronization which will add a unique co-operative based gameplay type, and being _completely_ customizable, ranging from custom maps, weapons, vehicles to Lua scripts that change the entire game logic.

-------------------------------------------------
## Features (Planned/Done)
* Dedicated servers
* Peer to peer
* Server content streaming
* Limit adjuster
* 3 scripting languages (Lua, AngelScript and JavaScript)
* Client-side scripting
* Integrated CEF (Chromium Embedded Framework) for rich HTML5+CSS3 powered user interfaces
* Synced A.I. characters
